This directory contains various files that affect aspects of the
operation of the HalfPipe:

flavor_* -- specify various flavors of FlightOps code to be used for
	setting up the execution environment.  In a checked-out
	instance used by the HalfPipe, one of these files should be
	symlinked to "flavor".

haltCleanup -- if present, do not perform cleanup actions

haltL1 -- if present, do not launch the L1 processing task

haltOnline -- if present, do not launch the Online analyses.

maxEvents -- if non-empty, use the contents to override the max events
	per chunk setting for writeMerge.exe in mergeEvt.sh

overrideLATCdecode.sh -- if executable and the output is non-empty use
	the result to override the LATC key in makeEvt.sh.

overrideLATCmerge.sh -- if executable and the output is non-empty use
	the result to override the LATC key in mergeEvt.sh.

sitedep.ini -- if non-empty, set ISOC_SITEDEP to point to the file in
	launchL1.sh.

stagedir -- specify the path to which halfpipe output should be staged
	for consumption by L1Proc.  Used in makeEvt.sh and launchL1.sh
